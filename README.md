Adapted from https://github.com/hermanjunge/kubernetes-digitalocean-terraform

Added examples for
* A simple node-js helloworld app (default on port 80)
* A more complete node-js app which reads/writes to a cockroach-db backend


TODO:
* Create database credentials automatically - in meantime run ./scripts/create-example-db
